# Java Todo App
> Simple todo application made for a university project 


## General Information
The application has a simple user login. Their tasks are stored in the database. Tasks can be deleted and their status changed. The application also has an option to filter the displayed tasks. 

Tasks in the database are managed by a server written in Node.js.

The interface was built in JavaFX Scene Builder.
I used the UI project from Frontend Mentor website.
